As a learning exercise, my teachers had their students recreate professional-level graphs, specifically those produced by FiveThirtyEight.com.

In doing this exercise, it amazed me how many ways the offered dataset could be represented, and it truly gave me an appreciation for the need for visualization of data that tells a *useful* story.  Admittedly, it also gave me a bit of a dopamine hit to struggle on some bit of coding gristle, only to overcome it and learn what I was doing wrong.  I can't wait to make more!  So... I won't!
