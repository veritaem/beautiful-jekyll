Action 1
---

 - Gathering data is the basis for this project, so I will need to not only gather a lot of polling data but also keep one ear to the ground for any new ones that come out that could be of relevance.  
 - If I am able to, I will set up a web scraper on RealClearPolitics, but if I cannot get it to work the way I want I can still update my project often.

Action 2
---

 - Gathering data is not enough.  With it, you also need to be able to parse meaning out of the polls.  For this, I will be looking at big stories that coincide with large drops or jumps in approval in order to see what kind of approval he has, whether its emotional, party driven, logical, demographic etc. 
 - For this, I will be looking particularly hard at the most popular partisan sites, in order to determine if the swings in popularity are due to his opponents being galvanized for a week or two/supporters being validated.
