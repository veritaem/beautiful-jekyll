Hello there, my name is Daniel Harris, a data scientist-in-training, a pleasure to meet you!  I was drawn to this field because of job opportunities and my love of predicting geopolitical moves and outcomes!  Currently, I am learning the foundations of data science, data wrangling, statistics, and machine learning. My best qualities would probably be:

- love of learning
- frequent idea generation
- ability to work more or less nonstop when the need arises
- 'worst to first' mentality


### What I want out of my work

I am focused on finding a way to give concreteness to political decisions.  Policy is now more important than ever, with the voices of the actors on the world stage both magnified and muffled by the sheer volume of information our modern world can produce and transmit.  Because of this, movements made on the world scale are felt far more immediately by the populace than ever, making accuracy and steady improvement a must.
